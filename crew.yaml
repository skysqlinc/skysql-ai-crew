name: SkySQL Semantic DB Crew
description: >
  An AI crew to converse using natural language with a SQL DB with high accuracy. 
  While it is possible to generate SQL given some schema description to a LLM or use APIs in frameworks, 
  it is rather challenging to generate accurate SQL for real-world DBs with high complexity.

  This crew addresses that challenge by gathering the correct semantic context,
  enabling humans to add domain knowledge (e.g. mapping terms to columns), and
  storing relevant data like schema, value categories, etc., in vector stores.

  SkySQL DB Agents provide a No-Code UI to autonomously learn the DB context.
  It is secure, reliable, and enables your CrewAI agents to interact with these Agents via simple tools.
